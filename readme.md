# Story

Hello today I got message from someone from steam.

At the beginning he said he want someone to join dota2 tournament team,  
surely I said ok, and he sends a link from challenger-mode to his team and he said did you see join button?  
But I didn't see anything so I ask him again and then he sends (currently 404) to me (First time I guess maybe
challenger-mode just generate that link for him)

UI part I think he just buy this website template from someone or maybe free from github.

Bad news is I put my credential into that website :( with steam guard and recovery code.
After I have known I got hacked because I have family mode turned on and they bruteforce and remove it (its gone from
steam ui), my steam session is logged out and I got chat message from fake steam user (their script add this user after
bruteforce family mode),  
Good news is they can't change password because it needs to be confirmed by mobile app  
BUT they have my steam guard recovery code!  so I quickly grab my phone and take my steam guard back to my phone, and
they just spam password reset confirmation to my steam mobile app, and I can't even change my password :(  
about 3 minutes later I'm able to change my password and I guess I'm safe now.
